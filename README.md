# DriveAware 🚦  
### Building ethical driving through awareness  

DriveAware is a structured awareness-based ethical driving training platform designed to build long-term responsible driving habits. Instead of focusing on punishment or enforcement, DriveAware promotes behavioral growth through progressive scenario-based challenges, real-time feedback, and positive reinforcement.

## 🌍 Problem Statement

Traffic rules exist everywhere, yet accidents continue to rise. The core issue is not the lack of rules but the lack of internalized ethical driving habits. Most drivers act responsibly only when enforcement is present. This temporary compliance does not create lasting behavior change.

DriveAware bridges this gap by transforming ethical driving awareness into a structured, progressive learning experience.

DriveAware provides:

- 50 progressive awareness-based chapters  
- 10 real-life scenario decisions per chapter  
- 60-second timed ethical decision challenges  
- Structured growth from basic awareness to advanced ethical thinking  
- Real-time feedback instead of punishment  
- Personal progress tracking  
- 20 achievement badges for milestones  
- Advanced analytics dashboard with visual insights  

The platform focuses on awareness, reflection, and improvement rather than competition or ranking.
